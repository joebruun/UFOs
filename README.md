# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana create a webpage that lets users use mutiple filters at once to view data on UFO sightings by city, state, country, shape, and date. 

## Results

Using the new updated version of the webpage allows users to filter data on UFOs very easily. Users simply input a certain criteria into any of the filter preferences and the webpage will automatically fitler to display any relevant data. If a user wants to fitler by state, California for example, they simply enter "ca" into the state fitler preferences. If the user wants to filter by shape, they can search for "circle" and any relevant searches will appear. Below are some examples of the webpage and what using many filter preferences at once looks like:

## Summary

**One drawback** to this webpage is that it doesn't correclty adapt its size depending on the device being used (phone, computer, tablet, etc). Therefore, **one recommendation** for further development could be to add some type of formatting that allows the webpage to readjust its sections and margins depending on what type of device it is being viewed on. 

Another **recommendation** for further development could be a type of input that the user provides. It could be a simple survey or questionaire that would ask the user about his/her experiences with UFO sightings. This would allow the webpage to include even more data, potentially even new data, that would be helpful in improving the webpage for users and others who are interested in extraterrestrial sightings.
